## CNN for Digit Recognition (MNIST)

We first built and trained a simple CNN model using the MNIST dataset:

- Two convolutional layers (5x5 filters)
- Max pooling (2x2) and dropout (0.5)
- Fully connected layer (50 nodes) + final FC with log-softmax (10 classes)
- Achieved **~98% test accuracy**

## Training Performance

- Loss decreased steadily over batches/epochs.
- Test loss visualized periodically across training examples.

## Filter Visualization

- First conv layer has 10 learned filters.
- Visualized using matplotlib to show edge/orientation detection.

## Transfer Learning to Greek Letters

- Fine-tuned MNIST CNN to classify Greek characters: Î±, Î², Î³.
- Froze earlier layers, retrained final classifier head.
- Achieved **96â€“98% accuracy** on unseen test samples.

## Transfer Learning Training Error

- Convergence observed over 100+ epochs.

## Live Webcam Digit Recognition

- Built a webcam-based interface using OpenCV
- Live input frames classified in real time using the trained CNN

> *Sometimes predictions were inaccurate due to motion blur or poor lighting, but most digits were correctly classified in real-time.*

## Key Takeaways

- 5x5 and 7x7 filters outperform 3x3 in MNIST CNNs
- Dropout around **0.1â€“0.3** provided best generalization
- Smaller batch sizes (32) resulted in better accuracy
- Greek letters transfer learning worked well with small data (~27 samples)
- Real-time system demonstrates CNNs are efficient and deployable
