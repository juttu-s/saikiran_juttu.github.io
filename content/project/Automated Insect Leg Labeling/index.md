This project proposes a robust and scalable method for automating insect leg labeling using **image processing, feature detection, and clustering**, enabling seamless integration with **DeepLabCut** for behavioral analysis.

---

## Methodology Overview

### 1. Data Collection  
- Captured insect locomotion data using a **ServoSphere** robot equipped with omni-wheels and a high-speed camera.
- The camera tracked an insect (ant) placed atop the rotating sphere.

---

### 2. Preprocessing Pipeline  
- **Grayscale conversion** and **Gaussian blur** for noise reduction  
- **Canny Edge Detection** for edge enhancement  
- **Binary thresholding** and **morphological operations** for skeletonization

---

### 3. Feature Extraction

- Applied **Shi-Tomasi Corner Detection** on Canny edges for precise joint detection
- Robust to noise and sensitive to detailed motion features

### 4. Body Removal

- Used **Zhang-Suen thinning** for skeleton extraction  
- Applied **connected component labeling** to segment body parts  
- Removed body via **template matching**

### 5. Leg Detection

- Remaining features correspond to legs  
- Calculated angles of features w.r.t. body centroid

---

### 6. Clustering & Tip Detection

- **KMeans (K=6)** clusters features into 6 legs  
- Furthest feature in each cluster = leg tip

![KMeans Clustering](kmeans.png)  
*Figure: KMeans clustering of features into 6 leg regions.*

---

### 7. Integration with DeepLabCut

- Created `.h5` files with clustered keypoints  
- Trained DeepLabCut on auto-labeled dataset  
- Achieved performance near manual labeling
