This project developed a **real-time webcam-based system** to detect and classify 2D objects using image segmentation, shape features, and distance-based classifiers. The system supports capturing and labeling training data interactively and recognizes both scale- and rotation-invariant objects.

### üß† Workflow

1. **Thresholding Input Frames**  
   - Dynamic thresholding via simplified K-means clustering  
   - Binary image separates object from background

2. **Morphological Filtering**  
   - Used dilation and erosion to clean noise and fill holes

3. **Connected Components & Region Segmentation**  
   - Identified distinct objects  
   - Filtered out small noisy components

4. **Feature Extraction**  
   - Centroids, central moments, bounding box, percent fill  
   - Orientation angle from least central moment

5. **Training Interface**  
   - Press `'n'` to label new objects and save features to CSV

6. **Classification (2 Methods)**  
   - **Baseline:** Scaled Euclidean distance  
   - **KNN (k=4):** Chosen label from majority of 4 nearest neighbors

7. **Confusion Matrix Evaluation**  
   - Achieved 93‚Äì100% accuracy on 5 classes  
   - Evaluated with multiple images per class under varied conditions

### üîß Extended Features

- Recognizes **11 total object classes**  
- Handles **multiple objects** simultaneously in a frame  
- Classifies objects even under **rotations and scaling**

This project combines classic computer vision with real-time systems and demonstrates how simple shape-based features can provide surprisingly effective results when paired with robust classification logic.
